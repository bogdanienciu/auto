				<p>Audi hasn't released prices yet, but you can be dead certain they'll line-up with its competitors. Call it mid-high thirties right up to proper 'if you have to ask' territory. And it's worth bearing in mind that while some of its flagship technologies will indeed be fitted as standard, others will be pricey options.</p>

				<p>Some are well worth having, though, like many of the 39 driver assistance systems Audi claims the A6 can be equipped with. If you spend a lot of time on motorways - as many A6 drivers do/will and indeed should, because that's where the A6 feels most at home - the adaptive cruise and traffic jam assists are worth their weight in gold. Exact specs for UK-market A6s have yet to be finalised.</p>				
				<p>However, once you've negotiated the process of buying or leasing your A6, it ought to be an easy and cost-effective thing to live with. We only know fuel economy figures for the 3.0-litre engines so far - but given the performance on offer they're actually pretty good. On small wheels, the TFSI will do 42mpg with CO2 emissions of 151g/km (better than the BMW equivalent), and the TDI 51mpg and 142g/km (on par with the BMW, better than the Merc). A mixed motorway/B-road run in the 2.0-litre yielded 48mpg with no trouble whatsoever.</p>

						<p>What is it like on the road?</p>

				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p>Sadly, that isn't yet. Like the A7 and A8, at launch you can choose between two engines of 3.0-litres and six-cylinders, one petrol and one diesel - the 55 TFSI and 50 TDI. The former gets a seven-speed 'S-tronic' dual-clutch gearbox, while the latter has an eight-speed auto. Both have Quattro AWD, but the petrol gets the newer version that uncouples the rear-axle when it isn't needed for better economy. The A7 and A8 ranges stop there, but the A6 adds a 2.0-litre diesel option - the 40 TDI - which also gets Quattro and the seven-speed DCT.</p>
					<p>A less powerful version of the 3.0-litre diesel - the 45 TDI, which we've tried - is available in other markets and may make it to the UK. We're guessing a plug-in hybrid will be added to the range before long (to compete with the Mercedes E350e and BMW 540e), along with a 2.0-litre petrol, an S6 and in time, an RS6 range-topper.</p>
					<p>All three launch engines get mild-hybrid technology, which uses a lithium-ion battery and belt alternator starter to give engine-off coasting between 34 and 99mph and super-smooth start/stop that kicks in when you drop below 14mph, and restarts when it senses the car ahead has moved off. Cars with this kind of tech have by far the smoothest stop/start systems - they'	re the only cars in which we don't immediately reach for the off button. Most of the time, you won't notice whether the engine's running or not - and that's precisely the point.</p>
					<p>We've tried all three available powertrains, and true to form there's not a duffer among them. The new 2.0-litre diesel is especially impressive - punchy (204bhp), exceptionally quiet and a good match for the DCT to which it's paired. As for the two 3.0-litres - see our A7 review. In isolation the TDI is a fine thing, but exposure to the TFSI (or Mercedes' new inline-six) really shows up its deficiencies - namely the extra volume and added vibrations. The petrol is whisper-quiet, satisfyingly brisk and unencumbered by the eight-speed auto - its DCT is sharper and more decisive.</p>
					<p>Today's A4 is as good an A4 as ever there's been because Audi concentrated on making it as quiet, comfortable and refined as possible. It didn't embark on a frankly unwinnable quest to make it better to drive than a BMW 3 Series or Jaguar XE. Which is why it's a bit worrying the A6's bumf is awash with words like 'sporty' and 'dynamic'. Audi claims its new model is "noticeably more agile" than the car it replaces. And for the most part, it's right. We'd stop short of calling it especially fun or in any way sporty, but the optional all-wheel steering system takes an easy foot out of the wheelbase and a metre out of the turning-circle, so is therefore well worth having.</p>
					<p>There are four different suspension options - which one you get (or are allowed to specify) depends on the engine and trim level you've chosen. Besides the standard, steel springs there's 'Sports Suspension' (a bit stiffer, lowers the body by 20mm), 'Suspension with Damper Control' (adds adaptive dampers and a 10mm drop from standard) and the top-of-the-line 'Adaptive Air Suspensio'. We've tried the last two (on admittedly quite smooth Portuguese mountain roads) and were impressed. Both setups seem to handle the A6's bulk without issue and give a smooth ride on even especially abrasive cobblestones, and in their firmest settings. The A7 suffers when you equip it with big alloys, but happily it seems Audi's fixed that problem for the A6. We'll give it a proper go in the UK, naturally, but early indications are 21s don't totally knacker the ride. Result, because they look proper.</p>

					<div class="col-sm-12">
						<p>Audi does interiors very well indeed. The design and layout of the A6's cabin is more or less identical to the A8 and A7's, and while it's bound to be cheaper to buy (Audi hasn't released prices just yet) the materials feel just as solid.</p>
						<p>All models get a version of the 'MMI Touch' interface that debuted on the A8, and has since been fitted to the A7 (and, would you believe, the Lamborghini Urus). In its ultimate form, it mates two touchscreens - one of 10.1 and the other of 8.6 inches - with the tried-and-tested 12.3 inch 'Virtual Cockpit' instrument cluster. The top touchscreen does infotainment and navigation, while the bottom takes care of the air conditioning. Haptic feedback - see your iPhone's home button - is supposed to make the system easier to use while driving, but with Virtual Cockpit you can (and should) do most of the important stuff using the click-wheels and buttons on the steering wheel. It's certainly a far better system than what Jaguar fits to its cars, but whether you prefer it to Mercedes' 'Command' interface or BMW's iDrive is, we reckon, entirely personal preference. They all do much the same thing nowadays, after all.</p>
						<p>The seats are excellent, if not quite as plush as an expensive 5 Series', and the driving position well-judged. But what impresses most about the A6 is how quiet it is. Whatever speed you're doing, whatever surface you're driving over, you need never speak to your passengers in anything more than a delicate whisper. You'd need some proper measuring equipment to see how much louder, if at all, the A6 is than the A8. We bet there's nothing in it.</p>
						<p>As for space - the A6 is physically bigger than the car it replaces, so naturally the interior is too. The 12mm longer wheelbase gives 21mm more legroom - trust us, you'll be fine in the back - and at 530-litres the boot is as big as the BMW's (and old A6's) and only 10-litres shy of the Merc's.</p>

								<p>Audi recommends that the A6 undergoes a minor service every 10,000 miles or 12 months and a major service every two years and 20,000 miles. Exact maintenance prices for new cars depend on the dealer, but fixed-price interim servicing for models over three years old starts at �159 for entry-level A6s fitted with 2.0-litre engines, with a major check-up costing �309. That rises to �199 and �399 respectively for cars with bigger engines, which covers most of the A6 range.</p>
